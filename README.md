# hangman_python

The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. It challenges players to guess a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time. The game starts by displaying a series of underscores, representing the letters of the word to be guessed. The player's objective is to correctly guess the word before running out of attempts.

At each turn, the player guesses a letter. If the letter is present in the word, it is revealed in the correct positions. If the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman's body is drawn on the screen. The player continues guessing letters until either they successfully guess the word or the hangman's body is completely drawn, resulting in a loss.
